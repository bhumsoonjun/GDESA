# About the repository

This repository contains the code of GDESA, MGDESA, and AGDESA.

## BaseGDESA.py
BaseGDESA is an abstract class that acts as a template containing useful utility functions shared by the three algorithms.

## GDESA.py, MGDESA.py, and AGDESA.py
These files contain the implementation of each algorithm.

# Examples
Example usages can be found in Main.py
